# SPACE-THEMED-CALCULATOR
“A CLI calculator with planetary mass logic and space-themed operations”
# 🌌 Space-Themed CLI Calculator

A Python-based command-line calculator with a cosmic twist! This project combines basic arithmetic operations with a planetary mass calculator that uses real gravity values from our solar system. Designed for beginner-to-intermediate learners, it’s both viva-ready and portfolio-friendly.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Add, subtract, multiply, divide cosmic values
- ✅ Calculate total mass on any planet for multiple people
- ✅ Uses real planetary gravity data from the solar system
- ✅ Modular, beginner-friendly code with error handling
- ✅ Space-themed prompts and emojis for engagement

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Choose an operation from the menu:
   - Basic arithmetic (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide)
   - Planetary mass calculator

2. For planetary mass:
   - Enter the planet name (e.g., Mars)
   - Enter number of visitors
   - Enter each person’s Earth weight individually

3. Get the total mass on that planet using gravity ratios!

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- CLI interface
- Dictionaries, loops, functions, error handling

## 📸 Sample Output

🌌 Welcome to the Space Calculator 🌌
1. Combine star masses (Add)
2. Calculate fuel difference (Subtract)
3. Boost thrust power (Multiply)
4. Split orbital distance (Divide)
5. Calculate total mass on a planet
6. Exit
choose an operation(1-6): 3
Enter first cosmic value: 34
Enter second cosmic value: 34
🪐result:  1156.0

Enter planet name (e.g., Mars): jupiter
How many people are visiting?: 2

⚖️ Enter the Earth weight for each of the 2 visitors:
Person 1 weight (kg): 56
Person 2 weight (kg): 59

🪐 Total mass on Jupiter: 290.61 kg
